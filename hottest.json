Specifically, Section 6.3 presents evaluation on a\ncollection of reasoning tasks, which require multi-step mathematical or common sense reasoning to\nproduce the correct answer. Prior state-of-the-art results use a combination of task-specific fine tuning,\ndomain-specific architectures, and task-specific verifiers to achieve strong results. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that when model scaling is combined with chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b),\nsimple few-shot evaluation can outperform or match the fine tuned state of the art on a wide array of\nreasoning tasks. In Section 6.2 we additionally highlight breakthrough performance on BIG-bench (BIG-\nbench collaboration, 2021), a recently released suite of 150+ new language understanding and generation\ntasks, many of which are extremely difficult even for humans to correctly answer.
