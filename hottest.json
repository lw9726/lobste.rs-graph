snippet from the introduction:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreakthrough capabilities – We demonstrate breakthrough capabilities in language understanding\nand generation across a number of difficult tasks. Specifically, Section 6.3 presents evaluation on a\ncollection of reasoning tasks, which require multi-step mathematical or common sense reasoning to\nproduce the correct answer. Prior state-of-the-art results use a combination of task-specific fine tuning,\ndomain-specific architectures, and task-specific verifiers to achieve strong results. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that when model scaling is combined with chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b),\nsimple few-shot evaluation can outperform or match the fine tuned state of the art on a wide array of\nreasoning tasks. In Section 6.2 we additionally highlight breakthrough performance on BIG-bench (BIG-\nbench collaboration, 2021), a recently released suite of 150+ new language understanding and generation\ntasks, many of which are extremely difficult even for humans to correctly answer. In Figure 1 and\nSection 9, we demonstrate exploratory capabilities in PaLM’s ability to explicitly interpret and explain\ncomplex reasoning chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/36lax1/palm_scaling_language_modeling_with","submitter_user":{"username":"danilafe","created_at":"2019-11-07T17:21:18.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"CS M.S. student interested in PLT, compilers, and much more.","is_moderator":false,"karma":504,"avatar_url":"/avatars/danilafe-100.png","invited_by_user":"shapr","github_username":"DanilaFe"},"tags":["ai","pdf"]},{"short_id":"oigvqv","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oigvqv","created_at":"2022-04-05T14:53:17.000-05:00","title":"Makatea: Qubes-like OS on seL4","url":"http://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/makatea","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/oigvqv/makatea_qubes_like_os_on_sel4","submitter_user":{"username":"ethoh","created_at":"2019-08-14T20:04:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":4497,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ethoh-100.png","invited_by_user":"dwaite"},"tags":["osdev","privacy","security","virtualization"]},{"short_id":"xckbqy","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xckbqy","created_at":"2022-04-05T13:57:13.000-05:00","title":"Warp: The terminal for the 21st century","url":"https://www.warp.dev/","score":5,"flags":2,"comment_count":9,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xckbqy/warp_terminal_for_21st_century","submitter_user":{"username":"sanxiyn","created_at":"2015-01-21T09:51:34.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I made the initial port of Rust to ARM and Android.","is_moderator":false,"karma":9465,"avatar_url":"/avatars/sanxiyn-100.png","invited_by_user":"steveklabnik","github_username":"sanxiyn","twitter_username":"sanxiyn"},"tags":["programming"]},{"short_id":"1lpkz2","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1lpkz2","created_at":"2022-04-06T00:22:28.000-05:00","title":"σ-driven project management: when is the optimal time to give up?","url":"https://erikbern.com/2022/04/05/sigma-driven-project-management-when-is-the-optimal-time-to-give-up.html","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/1lpkz2/driven_project_management_when_is","submitter_user":{"username":"jamesmacaulay","created_at":"2012-11-02T15:22:58.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":234,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jamesmacaulay-100.png","invited_by_user":"julie","github_username":"jamesmacaulay","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"jamesmacaulay","sig_hash":"fbede42805529ccd49e0eaa33d1a1a75b74c6e8bd53b672cc2a5b01a1fd0f9750f"}]},"tags":["math","practices"]},{"short_id":"a7cef1","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a7cef1","created_at":"2022-04-06T05:46:10.000-05:00","title":"Debian still having trouble with merged /usr","url":"https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/890219/12423853bab9657d/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/a7cef1/debian_still_having_trouble_with_merged","submitter_user":{"username":"Gaelan","created_at":"2021-12-13T09:00:53.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":110,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Gaelan-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"Gaelan","twitter_username":"GaelanSteele"},"tags":["culture","linux"]},{"short_id":"gtqfed","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gtqfed","created_at":"2022-04-05T12:39:49.000-05:00","title":"Introducing ReadySet","url":"https://blog.readyset.io/posts/introducing-readyset","score":4,"flags":2,"comment_count":4,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gtqfed/introducing_readyset","submitter_user":{"username":"grfn","created_at":"2021-02-16T12:54:49.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":24,"avatar_url":"/avatars/grfn-100.png","invited_by_user":"eta","github_username":"glittershark","twitter_username":"glittershark1"},"tags":["databases","distributed"]},{"short_id":"s1iayw","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s1iayw","created_at":"2022-04-06T03:33:02.000-05:00","title":"Breaking PCBs for Science -
