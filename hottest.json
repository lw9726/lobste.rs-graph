I've been working on this for the past ~12 months, lately full-time.\r\n\r\nI wasn't happy with the current state of web development, so I decided to write a completely new ecosystem from scratch. I went back to the \"good old days\", and took advantage of innovations like progressive enhancement, separation of concerns, and semantic web design. The result is a powerful alternative to frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte as well as toolchains like Vite, Next.js, and Astro.\r\n\r\nNue ecosystem is work-in-progress and today I'm releasing the tiny, but powerful core: Nue JS. It's an extremely small (2.3kb minzipped) JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's like React or Vue, but there are no hooks, effects, props, or other unusual abstractions on your way. Know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and you can build server-side components and reactive interfaces with ease.\r\n\r\nAll projects will be released under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any questions.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/goxx8g/nue_react_vue_vite_astro_alternative","submitter_user":{"username":"tipiirai","created_at":"2019-03-31T14:05:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":29,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tipiirai-100.png","invited_by_user":"ondreian"},"tags":["javascript","nodejs","show","web"]},{"short_id":"ysaoyk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ysaoyk","created_at":"2023-09-14T13:23:25.000-05:00","title":"In a git repository, where do your files live?","url":"https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/09/14/in-a-git-repository--where-do-your-files-live-/","score":31,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ysaoyk/git_repository_where_do_your_files_live","submitter_user":{"username":"eBPF","created_at":"2023-01-25T09:58:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"```\r\nopenpgp4fpr:05D3E01922319A7586B4B8D5023FF4C1A9D6BAFD\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nHey there!
