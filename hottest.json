Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":140,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["programming","video"]},{"short_id":"vyaimx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vyaimx","created_at":"2023-01-20T16:04:51.000-06:00","title":"Source code for Adobe PostScript 1.0 released","url":"https://computerhistory.org/blog/postscript-a-digital-printing-press/?_hsmi=242355795\u0026_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8frF7VzXO-ffqoGUATsxoRI24JMgSJv-Q8Ic0bUou5TYLoN5ZWdOAEbp8o_NaOUIGgKt7D5DbgGFp00TVUOAVaTc_OU0k7RRp1jf9CZzfOOlvff0c","score":1,"flags":1,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vyaimx/source_code_for_adobe_postscript_1_0","submitter_user":{"username":"lorddimwit","created_at":"2016-08-15T09:39:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":12761,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lorddimwit-100.png","invited_by_user":"cks","github_username":"deadpixi"},"tags":["historical","plt"]},{"short_id":"epwdiz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/epwdiz","created_at":"2023-01-19T06:49:21.000-06:00","title":"Gleam v0.26 released featuring incremental compilation and Deno runtime support","url":"https://gleam.run/news/v0.26-incremental-compilation-and-deno/","score":42,"flags":1,"comment_count":6,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/epwdiz/gleam_v0_26_released_featuring","submitter_user":{"username":"lpil","created_at":"2019-04-02T03:50:42.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1358,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lpil-100.png","invited_by_user":"djm","github_username":"lpil"},"tags":["erlang","javascript","release"]},{"short_id":"71zcqk","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/71zcqk","created_at":"2023-01-19T14:57:24.000-06:00","title":"Funny programming languages","url":"https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/funny-programming-languages/","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":9,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/71zcqk/funny_programming_languages","submitter_user":{"username":"azhenley","created_at":"2021-10-04T14:03:32.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I work on dev tools at Microsoft.

A vulnerable TRNG could be exploited to facilitate potential attacks or be related to a reduced key space, and eventually results in a compromised cryptographic system. A digital FIRO-/GARO-based TRNG with high throughput and high entropy rate was introduced by Jovan Dj. Golić (TC’06). However, the fact that periodic oscillation is a main failure of FIRO-/GARO-based TRNGs is noticed in the paper (Markus Dichtl, ePrint’15). We verify this problem and estimate the consequential entropy loss using Lyapunov exponents and the test suite of the NIST SP 800-90B standard. To address the problem of periodic oscillations, we propose several implementation guidelines based on a gate-level model, a design methodology to build a reliable GARO-based TRNG, and an online test to improve the robustness of FIRO-/GARO-based TRNGs. The gate-level implementation guidelines illustrate the causes of periodic oscillations, which are verified by actual implementation and bifurcation diagram. Based on the design methodology, a suitable feedback polynomial can be selected by evaluating the feedback polynomials. The analysis and understanding of periodic oscillation and FIRO-/GARO-based TRNGs are deepened by delay adjustment. A TRNG with the selected feedback polynomial may occasionally enter periodic oscillations, due to active attacks and the delay inconstancy of implementations. This inconstancy might be caused by self-heating, temperature and voltage fluctuation, and the process variation among different silicon chips. Thus, an online test module, as one indispensable component of TRNGs, is proposed to detect periodic oscillations. The detected periodic oscillation can be eliminated by adjusting feedback polynomial or delays to improve the robustness. The online test module is composed of a lightweight and responsive detector with a high detection rate, outperforming the existing detector design and statistical tests. The areas, power consumptions and frequencies are evaluated based on the ASIC implementations of a GARO, the sampling circuit and the online test module.

The detected periodic oscillation can be eliminated by adjusting feedback polynomial or delays to improve the robustness. The online test module is composed of a lightweight and responsive detector with a high detection rate, outperforming the existing detector design and statistical tests. The areas, power consumptions and frequencies are evaluated based on the ASIC implementations of a GARO, the sampling circuit and the online test module. The gate-level implementation guidelines promote the future establishment of the stochastic model of FIRO-/GARO-based TRNGs with a deeper understanding.\r\n\r\n[Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/040)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/jq0j3s/closer_look_at_chaotic_ring_oscillators","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95144,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["cryptography","hardware","pdf"]},{"short_id":"tzh69d","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tzh69d","created_at":"2023-01-20T14:12:55.000-06:00","title":"Glitch-free is not Enough","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/035.pdf","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eToday, resistance to physical defaults is a necessary criterion for masking schemes.
