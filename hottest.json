We recently released a [high-performance memory allocator](https://github.com/Microsoft/snmalloc), which was designed to be used with the [Verona language](https://github.com/Microsoft/Verona).  I remain actively involved in the [CHERI](https://chericpu.org) project, where I led the early language / compiler strand of the research.  \r\n\r\nI was on the FreeBSD Core Team for two terms, have been an LLVM developer since 2008, am the author of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (libobjc2 and associated clang support), and am responsible for libcxxrt and the BSD-licensed device tree compiler.
