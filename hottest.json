I'm John. I'm a computer programmer from Australia with over 20 years commercial experience. I used to be a C# programmer in the Microsoft world but about 10 years ago I jumped ship and now I program mostly on the LAMP stack. I consider programming my craft and I endeavour to be as good at it as I possibly can be.","is_moderator":false,"karma":70,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jj5-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"jj5"},"tags":["databases"]},{"short_id":"nj6lzd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nj6lzd","created_at":"2022-05-28T03:58:48.000-05:00","title":"vgtk: A declarative desktop UI framework for Rust built on GTK","url":"https://github.com/bodil/vgtk","score":18,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nj6lzd/vgtk_declarative_desktop_ui_framework","submitter_user":{"username":"rtpg","created_at":"2016-07-06T05:00:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2512,"avatar_url":"/avatars/rtpg-100.png","invited_by_user":"BruceM"},"tags":["rust"]},{"short_id":"7idig8","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7idig8","created_at":"2022-05-27T07:50:28.000-05:00","title":"Writing like a pro with vale \u0026 neovim","url":"https://bhupesh.me//writing-like-a-pro-with-vale-and-neovim/","score":40,"flags":0,"comment_count":11,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/7idig8/writing_like_pro_with_vale_neovim","submitter_user":{"username":"bhupesh","created_at":"2021-02-17T01:26:25.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Developer ‚Ä¢ FOSS Creator ‚Ä¢ Tech Writer\r\n---\r\nFind me on [Web](https://bhupesh-v.github.io) | [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/bhupeshimself) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V)","is_moderator":false,"karma":91,"avatar_url":"/avatars/bhupesh-100.png","invited_by_user":"sathyabhat","github_username":"Bhupesh-V"},"tags":["vim"]},{"short_id":"hu2xve","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hu2xve","created_at":"2022-05-28T19:42:18.000-05:00","title":"Debugging a mysterious Python crash","url":"https://blog.dend.ro/a-mysterous-python-crash/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hu2xve/debugging_mysterious_python_crash","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":91550,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["assembly","debugging"]},{"short_id":"zenhqg","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zenhqg","created_at":"2022-05-28T12:19:03.000-05:00","title":"LIMITS 2022 - Workshop on Computing within Limits","url":"https://computingwithinlimits.org/2022/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zenhqg/limits_2022_workshop_on_computing_within","submitter_user":{"username":"neauoire","created_at":"2018-12-31T17:43:59.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Developer living aboard a sailboat on the coast of Japan.","is_moderator":false,"karma":132,"avatar_url":"/avatars/neauoire-100.png","invited_by_user":"nikivi","github_username":"neauoire","twitter_username":"neauoire"},"tags":["performance"]},{"short_id":"rpjv2w","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rpjv2w","created_at":"2022-05-27T13:54:33.000-05:00","title":"A Conference About Software You Can Love","url":"https://kristoff.it/blog/software-you-can-love/","score":24,"flags":0,"comment_count":30,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rpjv2w/conference_about_software_you_can_love","submitter_user":{"username":"carlmjohnson","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carl M.
