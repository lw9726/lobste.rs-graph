We demonstrate how this slight degradation can be measured using a time-to-digital (TDC) converter when an adversary programs one into the target cloud FPGA.\r\nThis technique allows an attacker to ascertain previously safe information on cloud FPGAs, even after it is no longer explicitly present. Notably, it can allow an attacker who knows a non-secret \"skeleton\" (the physical structure, but not the contents) of the victim's design to (1) extract proprietary details from an encrypted FPGA design image available on the AWS marketplace and (2) recover data loaded at runtime by a previous user of a cloud FPGA using a known design. Our experiments show that BTI degradation (burn-in) and recovery are measurable and constitute a security threat to commercial cloud FPGAs. \r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17881)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sxk4lw/pentimento_data_remanence_cloud_fpgas","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":96511,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["hardware","pdf","security"]},{"short_id":"vfa5ar","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vfa5ar","created_at":"2023-04-03T19:13:53.000-05:00","title":"Yack: Return to Monkey Island dialogs","url":"https://www.grumpygamer.com/loom","score":9,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vfa5ar/yack_return_monkey_island_dialogs","submitter_user":{"username":"lorddimwit","created_at":"2016-08-15T09:39:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":13077,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lorddimwit-100.png","invited_by_user":"cks","github_username":"deadpixi"},"tags":["games"]},{"short_id":"kwrma0","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kwrma0","created_at":"2023-04-03T23:06:37.000-05:00","title":"Rust on the CH32V003","url":"https://noxim.xyz/blog/rust-ch32v003/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/kwrma0/rust_on_ch32v003","submitter_user":{"username":"projectgus","created_at":"2017-01-05T00:26:21.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":858,"avatar_url":"/avatars/projectgus-100.png","invited_by_user":"nickzoic","github_username":"projectgus","twitter_username":"projectgus"},"tags":["hardware","rust"]},{"short_id":"yaddnv","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yaddnv","created_at":"2023-04-04T01:39:26.000-05:00","title":"Pydantic V2 Pre Release blog post","url":"https://docs.pydantic.dev/blog/pydantic-v2-alpha/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yaddnv/pydantic_v2_pre_release_blog_post","submitter_user":{"username":"Sietsebb","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:32:51.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3069,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Sietsebb-100.png","invited_by_user":"asthasr"},"tags":["python","release"]},{"short_id":"uncy17","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uncy17","created_at":"2023-04-03T02:58:09.000-05:00","title":"GraphQL: From Excitement to Deception","url":"https://betterprogramming.pub/graphql-from-excitement-to-deception-f81f7c95b7cf","score":24,"flags":0,"comment_count":17,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uncy17/graphql_from_excitement_deception","submitter_user":{"username":"deejayy","created_at":"2021-07-12T16:23:45.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mainly in frontend development (Angular), but went thru the last 25 years in IT.","is_moderator":false,"karma":539,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deejayy-100.png","invited_by_user":"indigo","github_username":"deejayy"},"tags":["api","programming"]},{"short_id":"f3ubpp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f3ubpp","created_at":"2023-04-04T04:30:40.000-05:00","title":"Size Matters: An Exploration of Virtual Memory on iOS","url":"https://alwaysprocessing.blog/2022/02/20/size-matters","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/f3ubpp/size_matters_exploration_virtual_memory","submitter_user":{"username":"freddyb","created_at":"2017-02-02T09:12:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I like browser security and web security.
