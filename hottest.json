Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":90,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["design","unix"]},{"short_id":"gpinyp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gpinyp","created_at":"2023-01-09T13:48:16.000-06:00","title":"Declarative UI with mogwai 0.6 and mogwai-dom 0.1","url":"https://zyghost.com/blog/mogwai-0.6.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gpinyp/declarative_ui_with_mogwai_0_6_mogwai_dom_0","submitter_user":{"username":"schell","created_at":"2014-12-11T16:10:33.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":".ok()?","is_moderator":false,"karma":46,"avatar_url":"/avatars/schell-100.png","invited_by_user":"ocharles"},"tags":["rust","wasm"]},{"short_id":"y9uzyx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx","created_at":"2023-01-09T05:13:39.000-06:00","title":"Three Lessons from Threema: Analysis of a Secure Messenger","url":"https://breakingthe3ma.app/","score":17,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx/three_lessons_from_threema_analysis","submitter_user":{"username":"fkooman","created_at":"2015-09-14T06:39:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://fosstodon.org/@fkooman","is_moderator":false,"karma":1683,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fkooman-100.png","invited_by_user":"untitaker"},"tags":["cryptography","security"]},{"short_id":"53zhxm","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/53zhxm","created_at":"2023-01-09T17:09:46.000-06:00","title":"Building a location to time zone API with SpatiaLite and Datasette","url":"https://datasette.io/tutorials/spatialite","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/53zhxm/building_location_time_zone_api_with","submitter_user":{"username":"simonw","created_at":"2021-07-29T15:43:15.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Creator of https://datasette.io","is_moderator":false,"karma":900,"avatar_url":"/avatars/simonw-100.png","invited_by_user":"scoates","github_username":"simonw"},"tags":["api","databases"]},{"short_id":"227mqp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/227mqp","created_at":"2023-01-09T08:58:45.000-06:00","title":"A clean interface for org files (Emacs)","url":"https://github.com/rougier/book-mode","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/227mqp/clean_interface_for_org_files_emacs","submitter_user":{"username":"raphaelm","created_at":"2021-04-23T03:42:11.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":10,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raphaelm-100.png","invited_by_user":"denismerigoux"},"tags":["emacs"]},{"short_id":"abmhcx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/abmhcx","created_at":"2023-01-09T17:17:49.000-06:00","title":"In Defense of Testing Mocks","url":"https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/in-defense-of-testing-mocks/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/abmhcx/defense_testing_mocks","submitter_user":{"username":"azhenley","created_at":"2021-10-04T14:03:32.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I work on dev tools at Microsoft.
