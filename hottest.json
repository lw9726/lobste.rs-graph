have been working for years on Natural Language parsing technology, implementing a tool: XIP (Xerox Incremental Parser) that was used in my research team for over 16 years. As NLP was quickly shifting into Deep Learning, I moved my interest to programming languages, which appeared to me as a natural continuation of my work on grammars. I have so far implemented two languages, which are now in Open Source: Tamgu and LispE (github.com/naver/tamgu and github.com/naver/lispe).","is_moderator":false,"karma":184,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Claudius-100.png","invited_by_user":"qmacro"},"tags":["c++","lisp"]},{"short_id":"alhsh6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/alhsh6","created_at":"2023-10-31T23:57:06.000-05:00","title":"Raspberry PI OS: upgrading and cross-grading","url":"https://k1024.org/posts/2023/2023-10-31-raspberry-pi-upgrade-crossgrade/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/alhsh6/raspberry_pi_os_upgrading_cross_grading","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":24017,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["hardware","linux"]},{"short_id":"ubero5","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ubero5","created_at":"2023-10-30T15:18:30.000-05:00","title":"How to Beg/Borrow/Steal Your Way to a Cross Platform Bluetooth LE Library","url":"https://nonpolynomial.com/2023/10/30/how-to-beg-borrow-steal-your-way-to-a-cross-platform-bluetooth-le-library/","score":37,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ubero5/how_beg_borrow_steal_your_way_cross","submitter_user":{"username":"qdot","created_at":"2017-02-24T01:47:52.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Arctic fox.
