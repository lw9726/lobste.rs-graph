Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I’m a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I’m really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There’s so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I’ve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I’m not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":86,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["design","unix"]},{"short_id":"gbvwcr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gbvwcr","created_at":"2023-01-09T06:43:36.000-06:00","title":"Feeds: The Only Civilised Way to Read Online","url":"https://felixcrux.com/blog/feeds-the-only-civilised-way-to-read-online","score":13,"flags":2,"comment_count":4,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gbvwcr/feeds_only_civilised_way_read_online","submitter_user":{"username":"felixc","created_at":"2016-05-28T16:16:07.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":144,"avatar_url":"/avatars/felixc-100.png","invited_by_user":"Screwtape","github_username":"felixc"},"tags":["culture","web"]},{"short_id":"y9uzyx","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx","created_at":"2023-01-09T05:13:39.000-06:00","title":"Three Lessons from Threema: Analysis of a Secure Messenger","url":"https://breakingthe3ma.app/","score":16,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/y9uzyx/three_lessons_from_threema_analysis","submitter_user":{"username":"fkooman","created_at":"2015-09-14T06:39:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://fosstodon.org/@fkooman","is_moderator":false,"karma":1681,"avatar_url":"/avatars/fkooman-100.png","invited_by_user":"untitaker"},"tags":["cryptography","security"]},{"short_id":"227mqp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/227mqp","created_at":"2023-01-09T08:58:45.000-06:00","title":"A clean interface for org files (Emacs)","url":"https://github.com/rougier/book-mode","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/227mqp/clean_interface_for_org_files_emacs","submitter_user":{"username":"raphaelm","created_at":"2021-04-23T03:42:11.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":10,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raphaelm-100.png","invited_by_user":"denismerigoux"},"tags":["emacs"]},{"short_id":"zbvwrp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zbvwrp","created_at":"2023-01-09T12:20:20.000-06:00","title":"Vulkan Video decoding","url":"https://lynne.ee/vulkan-video-decoding.html","score":7,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zbvwrp/vulkan_video_decoding","submitter_user":{"username":"tgfrerer","created_at":"2020-07-29T05:36:54.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"graphics, mostly.","is_moderator":false,"karma":85,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tgfrerer-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B","github_username":"tgfrerer","twitter_username":"tgfrerer"},"tags":["graphics"]},{"short_id":"akgoai","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/akgoai","created_at":"2023-01-08T12:38:23.000-06:00","title":"What are you planning to learn in 2023?","url":"","score":42,"flags":0,"comment_count":73,"description":"\u003cp\u003eFollowing up from \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/thsihg/what_are_you_planning_learn_2022\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e I’d love to know what you Lobsters are planning to pick up in 2023!\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Following up from [this post](https://lobste.rs/s/thsihg/what_are_you_planning_learn_2022) I’d love to know what you Lobsters are planning to pick up in 2023!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/akgoai/what_are_you_planning_learn_2023","submitter_user":{"username":"siddhantgoel","created_at":"2017-06-14T23:22:38.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software Developer","is_moderator":false,"karma":1471,"avatar_url":"/avatars/siddhantgoel-100.png","invited_by_user":"stefantalpalaru","github_username":"siddhantgoel","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"siddhantgoel","sig_hash":"8adc354bdf3953e09fa146525cd3423fcbbaf7538fd297e85f4452039e7c256d0f"}]},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"32ew26","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/32ew26","created_at":"2023-01-09T12:24:07.000-06:00","title":"Intro to Redis Scripting with Lua","url":"https://www.novus.com/tech-blog/intro-to-redis-scripting-with-lua","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/32ew26/intro_redis_scripting_with_lua","submitter_user":{"username":"asteroid","created_at":"2020-01-29T13:58:14.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Writer.
