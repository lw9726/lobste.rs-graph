Here's my pull quote:\r\n\r\n\u003eWe did not set out to select the “best” or “most influential” papers. Instead, we created a collection of significant and often memorable papers from 1996 through 2020 that would tell a story of how research at ISCA progressed over those twenty-five years, each accompanied by a retrospective from the authors. The resulting volume is necessarily an imperfect compilation, with many significant contributions to ISCA and sister conferences missing. Still, we believe it tells an exciting and meaningful story.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bvzvvr/selected_papers_isca_50_retrospective","submitter_user":{"username":"mikemccracken","created_at":"2014-04-29T12:11:51.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Linux cluster infrastructure engineer at Cisco\r\n\r\nformerly worked at Canonical and Sun / Oracle.\r\n\r\nCS PhD from UCSD, worked broadly in large scale systems performance modeling and measurement.\r\n\r\nhttp://michael-mccracken.net/\r\n","is_moderator":false,"karma":458,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mikemccracken-100.png","invited_by_user":"kawera","github_username":"mikemccracken"},"tags":["hardware"]},{"short_id":"iyltho","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iyltho","created_at":"2023-06-28T18:07:12.000-05:00","title":"cargo-dist","url":"https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iyltho/cargo_dist","submitter_user":{"username":"kellogh","created_at":"2014-01-08T17:10:46.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2310,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kellogh-100.png","invited_by_user":"qbit","github_username":"tkellogg","twitter_username":"kellogh"},"tags":["rust"]},{"short_id":"j1bppo","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/j1bppo","created_at":"2023-06-28T12:59:24.000-05:00","title":"Include also moc files of headers","url":"https://frinring.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/include-also-moc-files-of-headers/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/j1bppo/include_also_moc_files_headers","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"🐋\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":21431,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["c++"]}]
