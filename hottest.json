Mostly for further analysis and debugging. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo find all the error logs with a particular substring in them, and then to inspect them visually.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo find logs for the particular request_id, user_id or trace_id and then to inspect them visually.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo calculate the number of successful/unsuccessful hacker attempts to SSH into your host.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo calculate stats over web logs for a particular ip, domain, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTo calculate the frequency of logs with particular substrings.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these tasks are easy to perform from command-line when logs are stored in plain files. Just start with \u003ccode\u003ecat /path/to/log | grep some-substring\u003c/code\u003e. Then iteratively apply the needed commands to the selected logs - \u003ccode\u003ewc\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eawk\u003c/code\u003e, more \u003ccode\u003egrep\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eless\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ehead\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003esort\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003euniq\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ecut\u003c/code\u003e, etc. - until the desired result is obtained. This approach serves great for analyzing locally stored logs on a few hosts. It doesn’t scale well for cases when logs should be analyzed across hundreds of hosts and/or  application instances. Of course, there are command-line tools for parallel execution of unix commands across hundreds of hosts, which can help with this case. But we wanted better solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we’ve got ElasticSearch and Grafana Loki. Both solutions allow collecting logs from hundreds of hosts/applications. But they totally screw up analysis of these logs. They provide awkward to use query languages with silly limitations (such as the number of returned log lines per query) and very limited integration with existing command-line tools for logs’ analysis mentioned above.

For example:\r\n\r\n- To find all the error logs with a particular substring in them, and then to inspect them visually.\r\n- To find logs for the particular request_id, user_id or trace_id and then to inspect them visually.\r\n- To calculate the number of successful/unsuccessful hacker attempts to SSH into your host.\r\n- To calculate stats over web logs for a particular ip, domain, etc.\r\n- To calculate the frequency of logs with particular substrings.\r\n\r\nAll these tasks are easy to perform from command-line when logs are stored in plain files. Just start with `cat /path/to/log | grep some-substring`. Then iteratively apply the needed commands to the selected logs - `wc`, `awk`, more `grep`, `less`, `head`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, etc. - until the desired result is obtained. This approach serves great for analyzing locally stored logs on a few hosts. It doesn't scale well for cases when logs should be analyzed across hundreds of hosts and/or  application instances. Of course, there are command-line tools for parallel execution of unix commands across hundreds of hosts, which can help with this case. But we wanted better solution.\r\n\r\nSo we've got ElasticSearch and Grafana Loki. Both solutions allow collecting logs from hundreds of hosts/applications. But they totally screw up analysis of these logs. They provide awkward to use query languages with silly limitations (such as the number of returned log lines per query) and very limited integration with existing command-line tools for logs' analysis mentioned above. For example, you cannot easily perform the equivalent of `cat /log/file | grep some-string | my-custom-script-for-analysis` when logs stored in ElasticSearch and Grafana Loki contain millions or billions of lines with `some-string` substring.\r\n\r\nElasticSearch and Loki also need non-trivial configuration, index creation, performance tuning and maintenance.
