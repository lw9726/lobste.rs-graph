Before that, I studied philosophy.\r\n\r\nOn the philosophy side, I'm chiefly interested in metaphysics (ontology and mathematics/formal systems \u0026 semantics) and deontological ethics (praise and blame, moral education, honesty \u0026 bad faith).\r\n\r\nOn the computational side, I'm chiefly interested in program analysis, security, and systems programming. I do a decent amount of professional open source work on projects that encompass some of those.\r\n\r\nMy opinions are my own and do not reflect those of any employer, institutions, affiliates, lovers or haters past, present, or future. They might also not even be mine anymore!\r\n\r\nSites: yossarian.net / blog.yossarian.net / twitter.com/8x5clPW2\r\n\r\n[ my public key: https://keybase.io/yossarian; my proof: https://keybase.io/yossarian/sigs/Rv6e3jLOTzYa5MqFuXV0hnLoYT7xTVeyHjwluVuZTX8 ]","is_moderator":false,"karma":887,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yossarian-100.png","invited_by_user":"trent","github_username":"woodruffw","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"yossarian","sig_hash":"4fd3ae5c9de3d431a6081661b7db925f39596750774fac6a98a36ad05ef272810f"}]},"tags":["python","security"]},{"short_id":"brceu4","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/brceu4","created_at":"2023-05-24T13:12:23.000-05:00","title":"Breaking SHA256: length extension attacks in practice (with Go)","url":"https://kerkour.com/sha256-length-extension-attacks","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/brceu4/breaking_sha256_length_extension","submitter_user":{"username":"Zamicol","created_at":"2013-09-10T11:59:49.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://zamicol.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":186,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Zamicol-100.png","invited_by_user":"qbit"},"tags":["cryptography","go","security"]},{"short_id":"mpfoqc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mpfoqc","created_at":"2023-05-24T09:12:19.000-05:00","title":"Line Rendering Deep Overview","url":"https://panthavma.com/articles/lines/deep-overview-extraction/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mpfoqc/line_rendering_deep_overview","submitter_user":{"username":"mikejsavage","created_at":"2013-11-10T02:38:16.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"mikejsavage.co.uk","is_moderator":false,"karma":3357,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mikejsavage-100.png","invited_by_user":"jonl"},"tags":["graphics"]},{"short_id":"xitdue","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xitdue","created_at":"2023-05-24T13:00:14.000-05:00","title":"The Fastest Maze-Solving Competition On Earth","url":"https://youtu.be/ZMQbHMgK2rw","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xitdue/fastest_maze_solving_competition_on","submitter_user":{"username":"toastal","created_at":"2021-07-12T04:15:50.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"a disciple of functional programming\r\n\r\nStop using Microsoft products; say _NO_ to neo-EEE including WSL, GitHub, Sponsors, Copilot, VS Code, Codespaces, Azure, npm, Teams","is_moderator":false,"karma":2162,"avatar_url":"/avatars/toastal-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"toastal","twitter_username":"toastal","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"toastal","sig_hash":"be4ea8b4b314c4342e5dd97f1d845cc8586de0b0ec40ab4cd872f31071eab6030f"}]},"tags":["ai","performance","video"]}]
