CHERI architectures have adopted two design decisions from Arm Morello: 1) CHERI architectures now clear tags rather than raising exceptions if an instruction attempts a non-monotonic modification of a capability; and 2) DDC and PCC no longer relocate legacy memory accesses by default. CHERI-RISC-V has received numerous updates to serve as a better baseline for an upstream standard proposal including a more mature definition of compressed instructions in capability mode. CHERI-x86- 64 now includes details of extensions to existing x86 instructions and proposed new instructions in a separate ISA reference chapter along with various other updates.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rlkuts/cheri_instruction_set_architecture","submitter_user":{"username":"nwf","created_at":"2023-07-14T10:31:17.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Computer architecture, operating systems, and programming languages weenie.","is_moderator":false,"karma":17,"avatar_url":"/avatars/nwf-100.png","invited_by_user":"david_chisnall"},"tags":["hardware","pdf","release"]},{"short_id":"bu9mfy","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bu9mfy","created_at":"2023-09-21T09:58:40.000-05:00","title":"Supply Chain Issues in PyPI","url":"https://stiankri.substack.com/p/supply-chain-issues-in-pypi","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bu9mfy/supply_chain_issues_pypi","submitter_user":{"username":"wayphinder","created_at":"2023-07-25T14:12:49.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":3,"avatar_url":"/avatars/wayphinder-100.png","invited_by_user":"Foxboron"},"tags":["python","security"]},{"short_id":"6nwmls","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6nwmls","created_at":"2023-09-20T07:39:30.000-05:00","title":"fzf - The Command-Line Fuzzy Finder","url":"https://muhammadraza.me/2023/fzf/","score":25,"flags":0,"comment_count":15,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/6nwmls/fzf_command_line_fuzzy_finder","submitter_user":{"username":"mraza007","created_at":"2019-11-01T11:53:44.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Ex @ AWS\r\n\r\nI’m currently working at a Fintech","is_moderator":false,"karma":962,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mraza007-100.png","invited_by_user":"rkeene","github_username":"mraza007","twitter_username":"muhammad_o7"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"yst7r6","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yst7r6","created_at":"2023-09-21T12:59:11.000-05:00","title":"Behind the scenes with FawltyDeps v0.13.0: Matching imports with dependencies","url":"https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-09-21-fawltydeps-mapping-strategy/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/yst7r6/behind_scenes_with_fawltydeps_v0_13_0","submitter_user":{"username":"myme","created_at":"2019-04-12T15:15:36.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Software developer by trade and passion: https://myme.no / https://mastodon.social/@myme","is_moderator":false,"karma":269,"avatar_url":"/avatars/myme-100.png","invited_by_user":"dlowe","github_username":"myme","twitter_username":"ubermyme"},"tags":["python"]}]
