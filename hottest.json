I have been at the company for the majority of my career and spent my time moving up in roles that were _likely_ created to encompass the work I was doing. I never discussed with my previous manager about what a career roadmap looked like and mostly just did my job and kept solving my problems and taking promotions.\r\n\r\nI moved into a leadership role (title: _Lead Software Developer_) about two years ago, and last year my old boss had left the company - leaving the GM to tap me to take on the responsibilities of running the team.\r\n\r\nI have been loving the job but one of the big concerns I have is that I _do not_ know how to provide good guidance or structure for career growth within my team. Because of this, I am asking you - **how are your teams structured and what paths for career growth do you have at your company?**\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sfoo81/how_are_your_teams_structured","submitter_user":{"username":"dsh","created_at":"2016-04-08T10:38:09.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Father, developer, producer, photographer.","is_moderator":false,"karma":807,"avatar_url":"/avatars/dsh-100.png","invited_by_user":"VISIONARY","github_username":"dsmithhayes","twitter_username":"dsmithhayes"},"tags":["ask","practices"]},{"short_id":"926cq7","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/926cq7","created_at":"2023-05-15T11:00:46.000-05:00","title":"Large language models and plagiarism","url":"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/large-language-models-and-plagiarism","score":30,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/926cq7/large_language_models_plagiarism","submitter_user":{"username":"river","created_at":"2016-04-03T11:33:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"(Deleted account)","is_moderator":false,"karma":5922,"avatar_url":"/avatars/river-100.png","invited_by_user":"355E3B"},"tags":["ai"]},{"short_id":"uoczhn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uoczhn","created_at":"2023-05-16T00:43:09.000-05:00","title":"Debian Installer Bookworm RC 3 release","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2023/05/msg00001.html","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/uoczhn/debian_installer_bookworm_rc_3_release","submitter_user":{"username":"ema","created_at":"2017-02-03T03:16:02.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://github.com/ema\r\nhttps://twitter.com/realEmaRocca","is_moderator":false,"karma":580,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ema-100.png","invited_by_user":"nkhumphreys"},"tags":["linux","release"]},{"short_id":"aplilu","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/aplilu","created_at":"2023-05-16T08:51:11.000-05:00","title":"Compiling Bigloo Scheme to WebAssembly","url":"https://blogs.igalia.com/compilers/2023/05/10/compiling-bigloo-scheme-to-webassembly/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/aplilu/compiling_bigloo_scheme_webassembly","submitter_user":{"username":"abhin4v","created_at":"2018-06-29T04:02:55.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://abnv.me/about","is_moderator":false,"karma":1118,"avatar_url":"/avatars/abhin4v-100.png","invited_by_user":"artagnon","github_username":"abhin4v"},"tags":["lisp","plt","wasm"]},{"short_id":"wdcoab","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wdcoab","created_at":"2023-05-16T17:16:17.000-05:00","title":"Logs Told Us It Was DNS, It Looked like DNS, It Had to Be DNS, It Wasn't DNS","url":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon23americas/presentation/malla","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wdcoab/logs_told_us_it_was_dns_it_looked_like_dns_it","submitter_user":{"username":"knl","created_at":"2017-07-21T07:12:24.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Senior software engineer specialized in distributed systems and low latency, high frequency trading infrastructure.","is_moderator":false,"karma":6654,"avatar_url":"/avatars/knl-100.png","invited_by_user":"james","github_username":"knl","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"knl","sig_hash":"cb1fe17fead6d360f9abca902132b2407ee736f1a243f615ad9757dfe8d17e3b0f"}]},"tags":["debugging","distributed"]}]
