Results suggest that although Julia generates a reasonable LLVM-IR, a nearly 50% performance difference exists vs. native AMD HIP stencil codes when running on the GPUs. As expected, we observed near-zero overhead when using MPI and parallel I/O bindings for system-wide installed implementations. Consequently, Julia emerges as a compelling high-performance and high-productivity workflow composition language, as measured on the fastest supercomputer in the world.","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dmabyw/julia_as_unifying_end_end_workflow","submitter_user":{"username":"codekobold","created_at":"2023-08-06T00:34:42.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"I like software that sparks joy, tabletop role-playing games and learning new things.\r\n\r\nMost of my current work consists in designing and implementing high-performance data analysis interfaces for high-energy physics that are still ergonomic to the mean-square physicist.","is_moderator":false,"karma":172,"avatar_url":"/avatars/codekobold-100.png","invited_by_user":"azeemba","github_username":"eguiraud"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["performance","programming"]},{"short_id":"gju6ox","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gju6ox","created_at":"2023-11-20T09:54:08.000-06:00","title":"River: a Fast, Robust Job Queue for Go + Postgres","url":"https://brandur.org/river","score":21,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gju6ox/river_fast_robust_job_queue_for_go","submitter_user":{"username":"carlana","created_at":"2021-07-19T11:55:18.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Carlana Johnson is a philosopher and programmer, currently employed as the Director of Technology for Spotlight PA.","is_moderator":false,"karma":15175,"avatar_url":"/avatars/carlana-100.png","invited_by_user":"peterbourgon","github_username":"carlmjohnson"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["databases","go"]},{"short_id":"vrwyhz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vrwyhz","created_at":"2023-11-21T03:34:18.000-06:00","title":"Interactive Common Lisp development","url":"https://www.n16f.net/blog/interactive-common-lisp-development/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/vrwyhz/interactive_common_lisp_development","submitter_user":{"username":"signal-11","created_at":"2018-07-07T07:19:08.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":362,"avatar_url":"/avatars/signal-11-100.png","invited_by_user":"river"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["lisp","programming"]},{"short_id":"otm1xz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/otm1xz","created_at":"2023-11-21T08:15:30.000-06:00","title":"Linearizability versus Serializability (2014)","url":"http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/otm1xz/linearizability_versus","submitter_user":{"username":"eatonphil","created_at":"2019-09-01T20:23:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Info at eatonphil.com.\r\n\r\nphil@eatonphil.com","is_moderator":false,"karma":5470,"avatar_url":"/avatars/eatonphil-100.png","invited_by_user":"calvin","github_username":"eatonphil","twitter_username":"eatonphil"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["databases","distributed"]}]
