However, there is plenty of evidence that companies will not pay for what software they use until they realize that there is a problem, such as log4j, OpenSSL, and probably plenty others.\nThen there are the cases where companies are outright violating licenses such as the violations of the GPL with regards to OBS Studio by TikTok, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, of course, Copilot might be used to launder code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves me with the impression that companies will not pay if they can get away with it, and getting away with it might even include breaking the law since the little guy does not have resources to sue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there seems to be a glimmer of hope: copyleft licenses with the option for companies to purchase a commercial license. (This is an option for me because I‚Äôm writing the code from scratch.) Based on some previous comments on the orange site (like \u003ca href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29524103\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e), it seems that even this may not work, which would be sad. But I thought I would ask here before I throw in the towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address things like Qt, obviously, dual licensing makes money for companies because if they dual license their stuff, other companies will pay because they are afraid of being sued be someone with enough resources to win. But as I alluded to above, that‚Äôs not really the case for an individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I would like to hear your thoughts and experiences about using copyleft with commercial licenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes dual licensing work? Do companies pay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way, by ‚Äúeffective,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean that every company follows the license. All I want is for just enough of them to purchase a license and/or support to pay 2 times the typical developer salary. (I need 2 times the salary for tax purposes.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I also have a meta-question: when companies violate licenses, how often are they just bluffing? Is serving them with a lawsuit enough? Or will they fight what they know is a losing battle?\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nxaxl5/how_effective_is_copyleft_with","submitter_user":{"username":"gavinhoward","created_at":"2021-02-28T13:15:57.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://gavinhoward.com/","is_moderator":false,"karma":319,"avatar_url":"/avatars/gavinhoward-100.png","invited_by_user":"sams"},"tags":["ask","law"]},{"short_id":"mrkanc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mrkanc","created_at":"2022-01-07T07:42:50.000-06:00","title":"Ruby: How to Run a Rack app in a Background Thread","url":"https://www.johnnunemaker.com/ruby-rack-background-thread/","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mrkanc/ruby_how_run_rack_app_background_thread","submitter_user":{"username":"jnunemaker","created_at":"2020-12-30T20:05:13.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Programmer/owner at [Fewer \u0026 Faster](https://fewerandfaster.com) and [Box Out Sports](https://boxoutsports.com)","is_moderator":false,"karma":44,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jnunemaker-100.png","invited_by_user":"soulcutter"},"tags":["ruby"]},{"short_id":"iu5hgf","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iu5hgf","created_at":"2022-01-07T07:17:14.000-06:00","title":"Lazarus Release 2.2.0","url":"https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php?topic=57752.0","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":4,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/iu5hgf/lazarus_release_2_2_0","submitter_user":{"username":"raymii","created_at":"2013-11-20T11:58:43.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"üêã\r\nhttps://raymii.org","is_moderator":false,"karma":14473,"avatar_url":"/avatars/raymii-100.png","invited_by_user":"journeysquid"},"tags":["release"]},{"short_id":"dufahi","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dufahi","created_at":"2022-01-07T10:11:57.000-06:00","title":"Ranges and suffering","url":"https://kaylynn.gay/blog/post/rust_ranges_and_suffering","score":11,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/dufahi/ranges_suffering","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Dad.
