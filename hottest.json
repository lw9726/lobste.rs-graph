Since these vulnerabilities were from API specifications, not HTML forms, we proposed a ReDoS defense for a popular API validation library, and our patch has been merged. To summarize: in client-visible sanitization logic, some web services advertise ReDoS vulnerabilities in plain sight. Our results motivate short-term patches and long-term fundamental solutions. \r\n\r\n[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01996)","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/eo34qk/exploiting_input_sanitization_for_regex","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":95949,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["pdf","programming","security"]},{"short_id":"86ru2o","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/86ru2o","created_at":"2023-03-11T21:46:07.000-06:00","title":"A Novel Related Nonce Attack for ECDSA","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/305.pdf","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eWe describe a new related nonce attack able to extract the\noriginal signing key from a small collection of ECDSA signatures generated with weak PRNGs.
