Kildaire (or deavmi on the Internet) and I‚Äôm a computer programmer. I love tinkering around with all the bits of software that my computer runs but typically more on the low-level sides of things. I‚Äôm really interested in how operating systems work as a whole and their components such as kernels, networking stacks, linking-loaders, IPC, paging, virtual memory, file-systems and the list goes on. There‚Äôs so much to learn from understanding these complex systems and each aspect of them never leaves me bored!\r\n\r\nYou could call me a language enthusiast, from the design to the implementation. I always want to know how things work and I‚Äôve even spent time reading the source code for some language runtimes to get a better understanding. If I am feeling creative then I try write my own or write something in Forth! I love building networks too - I have an interest in setting up inter-networks with routing protocols, assigning numbers and setting up tunnels in order to build a huge network that I can play around on. When I‚Äôm not using other peoples' protocols I am busy writing my own to see what I can cobble out to itch my scratch on trying interesting concepts out.\r\n\r\nI like a good glass of red wine and cheese. I have an avid enjoyment for music from the 70s and the 80s and have rather interesting political views (nothing to be alarmed of) but most importantly I like to help others learn and put a smile on their face.","is_moderator":false,"karma":43,"avatar_url":"/avatars/deavmi-100.png","invited_by_user":"duclare","github_username":"deavmi","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"tristankildaire","sig_hash":"4397ec164f1a65b7fd0803bc85cd0b12d06cb2606c2ae0a27795dd90e98e219c0f"}]},"tags":["c","programming","testing"]},{"short_id":"qya5ak","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qya5ak","created_at":"2023-01-04T02:25:09.000-06:00","title":"JVM Anatomy Quark #11: Moving GC and Locality","url":"https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/11-moving-gc-locality/","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/qya5ak/jvm_anatomy_quark_11_moving_gc_locality","submitter_user":{"username":"jmiven","created_at":"2014-04-27T18:35:23.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1206,"avatar_url":"/avatars/jmiven-100.png","invited_by_user":"kev009","github_username":"jmiven"},"tags":["java","performance"]},{"short_id":"idu6ni","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/idu6ni","created_at":"2023-01-03T20:11:53.000-06:00","title":"The MOS 6502 is (mostly) Turing-complete without registers","url":"https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-mos-6502-is-mostly-turing-complete.html","score":2,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"\u003cp\u003eInspired by \u003ca href=\"https://lobste.rs/s/jpm5iw/x86_is_turing_complete_with_no_registers\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003ehttps://lobste.rs/s/jpm5iw/x86_is_turing_complete_with_no_registers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","description_plain":"Inspired by https://lobste.rs/s/jpm5iw/x86_is_turing_complete_with_no_registers","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/idu6ni/mos_6502_is_mostly_turing_complete","submitter_user":{"username":"classichasclass","created_at":"2018-11-05T18:45:47.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"no you're off topic","is_moderator":false,"karma":2728,"avatar_url":"/avatars/classichasclass-100.png","invited_by_user":"sevan"},"tags":["assembly","compilers"]}]
