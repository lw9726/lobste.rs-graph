That is important so that the naming suggestions reflect the reality of what the project is (which is pretty mature by now)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/OSH-versus-Oil\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) The project now has parts that aren't \"shells\"\r\n\r\nIncluding data languages like [QSN](https://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/qsn.html) (which will move toward JSON)\r\n\r\n(3) People who encounter the project for the first time often feel a bad connotation of \"Oil\" and \"Oil Shell\", explained in the release comments thread\r\n\r\n(4) There are existing \"oil\" and \"oilshell\" packages in some distros of the Python reference implementation.\r\n\r\nI'd like to standardize on \"oils-for-unix\" for the new C++ implementation.  The C++ one shouldn't overwrite the Python one suddenly -- there should be a gradual transition where both are available.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'd like the solicit alternatives for the name, and here are some desirable properties.\r\n\r\nI'd like a name that is globally unique, hence the somewhat long \"Oils for Unix\" name.
