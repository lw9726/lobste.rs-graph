Like the battle- tested immutable sequences of Clojure and Scala, they have effectively constant lookup and updates, good cache utilization, but also logarithmic concatenation and slicing. Our goal is to bring the benefits of func- tional data structures to the discipline of systems programming via generic yet efficient immutable vectors supporting transient batch updates. We describe a C++ implementation that can be integrated in the runtime of higher level languages with a C core (Lisps like Guile or Racket, but also Python or Ruby), thus widening the access to these persistent data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/nndizu/persistence_for_masses_rrb_vectors","submitter_user":{"username":"snej","created_at":"2020-01-26T19:05:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Mobile Architect at Couchbase.
