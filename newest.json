Let me define that:\nIf, hypothetically, git would show each positive and negative hunk together,\nyou could at least have compared them by sight, and that would have been humanly possible.\nBut instead, it‚Äôs a scattered puzzle, and just beginning to unravel that makes my hand hurt due to the scrolling distances involved. Yes, I‚Äôm physically damaged by the need for scrolling speed,\nto the point where I can only use vertical mice, and vertical mice that can freewheel don‚Äôt exist for some reason, which is a big problem.\nSo I‚Äôm not looking at the diff. Instead, my approach to situations like this\nis to iteratively look at the diffstat as the silhouette of probable moves\nand try to undo them one by one to reduce the problem until it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs left.\nThe diff is so not a representation of what happened\n‚Äì and reading that out of it, so not a job for a mere mortal ‚Äì\nthat it‚Äôs easier to do the work twice to discover what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/rl9pxx/idea_move_hunk","submitter_user":{"username":"anordal","created_at":"2017-08-17T01:45:52.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":548,"avatar_url":"/avatars/anordal-100.png","invited_by_user":"xyproto"},"tags":["rant","vcs"]},{"short_id":"ndb4wd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ndb4wd","created_at":"2022-02-01T18:52:30.000-06:00","title":"How to teach programming (and other things)? - 2019","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ndb4wd/how_teach_programming_other_things_2019","submitter_user":{"username":"marcellerusu","created_at":"2018-12-14T13:32:39.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"they/them","is_moderator":false,"karma":45,"avatar_url":"/avatars/marcellerusu-100.png","invited_by_user":"yfjd01"},"tags":["culture","education","video"]},{"short_id":"fmkxxp","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fmkxxp","created_at":"2022-02-01T18:40:10.000-06:00","title":"Getting rid of the need for the usecase Linux distribution","url":"https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/02/01/getting-rid-of-the-need-for-the-usecase-linux-distribution/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/fmkxxp/getting_rid_need_for_usecase_linux","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":88518,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["linux"]},{"short_id":"gq1lzb","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gq1lzb","created_at":"2022-02-01T18:33:07.000-06:00","title":"How I hacked my Sonos to play YouTube videos on it","url":"https://www.deadf00d.com/post/how-i-hacked-sonos-and-youtube-the-same-day.html","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":2,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/gq1lzb/how_i_hacked_my_sonos_play_youtube_videos","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":88518,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["reversing"]},{"short_id":"mnd3kn","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mnd3kn","created_at":"2022-02-01T17:52:59.000-06:00","title":"Git 2.34 has changed how you configure fast-forward only pulls and rebasing","url":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GitPullConfigAndRebase","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":10,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mnd3kn/git_2_34_has_changed_how_you_configure_fast","submitter_user":{"username":"telemachus","created_at":"2012-08-10T12:36:05.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":276,"avatar_url":"/avatars/telemachus-100.png","invited_by_user":"jcs"},"tags":["practices","programming","vcs"]},{"short_id":"ltnxkq","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ltnxkq","created_at":"2022-02-01T17:49:58.000-06:00","title":"WebVM: server-less x86 virtual machines in the browser","url":"https://leaningtech.com/webvm-server-less-x86-virtual-machines-in-the-browser/","score":8,"flags":1,"comment_count":4,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ltnxkq/webvm_server_less_x86_virtual_machines","submitter_user":{"username":"startupandrew","created_at":"2021-12-15T12:22:11.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":7,"avatar_url":"/avatars/startupandrew-100.png","invited_by_user":"dpaola2"},"tags":["web"]}]
