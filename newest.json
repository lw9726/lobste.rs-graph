The researchers said SLOW5 can process nanopore sequencing “more than 30 times faster” than the older FAST5 file format. FAST5-formatted data routinely yields files of 1.3 terabytes following a two-week processing job for computers; SLOW5 cuts the processing time to 12 hours. Garvan’s Hasindu Gamaarachchi said SLOW5 facilitates parallel computing, so several processors can perform multiple analyses
