From mid-2017 to late 2020, I worked for Microsoft on the Windows accessibility team, though my comments were always my own opinion posted on my own initiative.\r\n\r\nI'm legally blind myself; I have enough sight to read a desktop computer screen up close with slightly enlarged fonts, but I often use a screen reader when browsing the Web, doing email, and other tasks that don't involve code. (Don't get me wrong; totally blind people can program, but I never got used to doing it that way myself.)\r\n\r\nOf course, there's more to me than visual impairment. When it comes to programming, I'm also particularly interested in the challenges of developing cross-platform applications that integrate smoothly with the host platform. Outside of programming, I love music and love to sing. Pre-COVID, I often did karaoke (of course, I memorize the words). And like many nerds, I read science fiction.\r\n\r\nEmail: mattcampbell@pobox.com\r\n\r\nTwitter: @mw_campbell\r\n\r\nBlog: http://mwcampbell.us/blog/","is_moderator":false,"karma":1701,"avatar_url":"/avatars/mwcampbell-100.png","invited_by_user":"nolan"},"tags":["devops","linux"]},{"short_id":"ep1kb1","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ep1kb1","created_at":"2022-02-03T12:41:39.000-06:00","title":"A technique to semi-automatically find vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins","url":"http://kazet.cc/2022/02/03/fuzzing-wordpress-plugins.html","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/ep1kb1/technique_semi_automatically_find","submitter_user":{"username":"NieDzejkob","created_at":"2021-05-06T06:49:21.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Striving to learn as much as possible in Math ∪ Computer Science ∖ Machine Learning, with strong tendencies towards proof assistants, automated reasoning, compilers, programming language theory, software bootstrapping, abstract algebra, cryptography, and security.\r\n\r\nPlaying CTF at p4.team every now and then.","is_moderator":false,"karma":453,"avatar_url":"/avatars/NieDzejkob-100.png","invited_by_user":"jix","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"niedzejkob","sig_hash":"b0430d6a6e06124e80a3fadf619f22345584426c7baa4b557f01d6a79331d9340f"}]},"tags":["php","security"]},{"short_id":"zkhzf4","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zkhzf4","created_at":"2022-02-03T12:35:18.000-06:00","title":"Fedora and pkexec","url":"https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/883547/d2b752eb979b3eb1/","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/zkhzf4/fedora_pkexec","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":88558,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["linux","security"]},{"short_id":"upszbh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upszbh","created_at":"2022-02-03T12:22:37.000-06:00","title":"Wolvic - a new project based on Firefox Reality","url":"https://www.igalia.com/2022/02/03/Introducing-Wolvic.html","score":1,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/upszbh/wolvic_new_project_based_on_firefox","submitter_user":{"username":"ctb_","created_at":"2017-07-12T15:36:55.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://fourone.org/~ctb","is_moderator":false,"karma":27,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ctb_-100.png","invited_by_user":"hao","github_username":"ctbfourone","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"ctbrentano","sig_hash":"b39c587552e17df98ae19ca578279dc867521f4e571e6d0ab01baf4f18eefc040f"}]},"tags":["browsers"]},{"short_id":"viqogr","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/viqogr","created_at":"2022-02-03T10:03:47.000-06:00","title":"Epicyon ActivityPub server release version 1.3.0","url":"https://libreserver.org/epicyon/v1_3_0.html ","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/viqogr/epicyon_activitypub_server_release","submitter_user":{"username":"bashrc","created_at":"2018-07-03T05:31:28.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Free Software developer and maintainer of the Freedombone and Epicyon projects.

The researchers said SLOW5 can process nanopore sequencing “more than 30 times faster” than the older FAST5 file format. FAST5-formatted data routinely yields files of 1.3 terabytes following a two-week processing job for computers; SLOW5 cuts the processing time to 12 hours. Garvan’s Hasindu Gamaarachchi said SLOW5 facilitates parallel computing, so several processors can perform multiple analyses simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-file-format-helping-researchers-reduce-dna-analysis-time/\" rel=\"ugc\"\u003eNew file format helping researchers reduce DNA analysis time | ZDNet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bedvbc/slow5lib_is_software_library_for_reading","submitter_user":{"username":"faitswulff","created_at":"2017-04-03T00:20:29.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":1517,"avatar_url":"/avatars/faitswulff-100.png","invited_by_user":"gsylvie"},"tags":["c++","python"]},{"short_id":"tzsb0o","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tzsb0o","created_at":"2022-02-02T16:29:36.000-06:00","title":"Moving From Manual Reverse Engineering of UEFI Modules To Dynamic Emulation of UEFI Firmware","url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/moving-from-manual-reverse-engineering-of-uefi-modules-to-dynamic-emulation-of-uefi-firmware/","score":3,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/tzsb0o/moving_from_manual_reverse_engineering","submitter_user":{"username":"calvin","created_at":"2014-07-01T06:47:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Soon we will all have special names... names designed to make the cathode ray tube resonate.\r\n\r\nDavid Chisnall stan account.","is_moderator":false,"karma":88558,"avatar_url":"/avatars/calvin-100.png","invited_by_user":"nbyouri","github_username":"NattyNarwhal"},"tags":["osdev","reversing"]},{"short_id":"8a5kvz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8a5kvz","created_at":"2022-02-02T15:48:07.000-06:00","title":"Solving (Some) Formal Math Olympiad Problems","url":"https://openai.com/blog/formal-math/","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/8a5kvz/solving_some_formal_math_olympiad","submitter_user":{"username":"NieDzejkob","created_at":"2021-05-06T06:49:21.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Striving to learn as much as possible in Math ∪ Computer Science ∖ Machine Learning, with strong tendencies towards proof assistants, automated reasoning, compilers, programming language theory, software bootstrapping, abstract algebra, cryptography, and security.\r\n\r\nPlaying CTF at p4.team every now and then.","is_moderator":false,"karma":453,"avatar_url":"/avatars/NieDzejkob-100.png","invited_by_user":"jix","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"niedzejkob","sig_hash":"b0430d6a6e06124e80a3fadf619f22345584426c7baa4b557f01d6a79331d9340f"}]},"tags":["ai","formalmethods","math"]},{"short_id":"s0akpi","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s0akpi","created_at":"2022-02-02T14:26:44.000-06:00","title":"Testing Distributed Systems","url":"https://asatarin.github.io/testing-distributed-systems/","score":4,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/s0akpi/testing_distributed_systems","submitter_user":{"username":"eatonphil","created_at":"2019-09-01T20:23:02.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Building [open-source data tools](https://multiprocess.io).\r\n\r\nRunning a [Discord server](https://discord.multiprocesss.io) for devs tackling databases, compilers, emulators, operating systems, etc. And a companion [monthly virtual lightning talk series](https://multiprocess.io/hackernights).\r\n\r\nPreviously a developer and manager at Oracle, Capsule8 (now Sophos), Linode.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\n  * [Blog](https://notes.eatonphil.com)\r\n  * [Github](https://github.com/eatonphil)\r\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phil_eaton)\r\n  * [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/user/show/50930981-phil-eaton)","is_moderator":false,"karma":2356,"avatar_url":"/avatars/eatonphil-100.png","invited_by_user":"calvin","github_username":"eatonphil","twitter_username":"phil_eaton"},"tags":["distributed"]},{"short_id":"xlcdyc","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xlcdyc","created_at":"2022-02-02T13:31:44.000-06:00","title":"LiveBeats: Building a social music app with Phoenix LiveView","url":"https://fly.io/blog/livebeats/","score":2,"flags":1,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/xlcdyc/livebeats_building_social_music_app_with","submitter_user":{"username":"vorce","created_at":"2018-09-07T06:14:59.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://forvillelser.vorce.se/about.html","is_moderator":false,"karma":234,"avatar_url":"/avatars/vorce-100.png","invited_by_user":"sbr"},"tags":["elixir"]}]
