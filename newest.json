with ‚Äúhey can you help me with this technical problem‚Äù and sometimes it turns into me being the guy junior devs come to for tricky bugs, sometimes it‚Äôs a more comprehensive technical design/workplace issues/career advice kind of outlet. I enjoy being able to help people and in more cynical moments it‚Äôs felt like the only thing I do in my job that‚Äôs having any kind of positive impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately though I‚Äôve been thinking that mentoring less experienced devs in whatever company I‚Äôm with at the moment is great, but in some sense folks that have gotten through education (be it college or some kind of bootcamp thing) aren‚Äôt the people that could benefit from mentorship the most, given they‚Äôre already in the industry and often have access to plenty of other forms of membership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was a teenager struggling to stand up a fansite or scratching my head over stack traces I was really lucky to have a technical mentor, just someone I had met on a forum, who took the time now and then to point me in the right direction. They really didn‚Äôt invest a ton, just took the time to explain why I didn‚Äôt need the latest and greatest stack or a distributed database, explained that the mysterious dollar sign I saw everywhere actually meant ‚Äújquery‚Äù, stuff like that. But it was amazingly helpful to me and I owe this random person who took some time out of their day to help me now and then for helping me get to where I am. I‚Äôd love to be able to pay that forward in some way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo question here is if any crustaceans have experience with this kind of ‚Äúpro bono‚Äù mentorship, and if so do you find it rewarding? What channels are there for offering this kind of mentorship? I searched around a bit and found plenty of services that seem a lot like paid tutoring, but that‚Äôs definitely not what I‚Äôm looking for, I never would have had access to something like that when I needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/mw0xd7/providing_mentorship_outside_workplace","submitter_user":{"username":"Lanny","created_at":"2014-04-02T17:26:12.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":265,"avatar_url":"/avatars/Lanny-100.png","invited_by_user":"kev009"},"tags":["ask","education"]},{"short_id":"bnveyz","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bnveyz","created_at":"2022-01-05T13:03:23.000-06:00","title":"Hunting Tech Debt via Org Charts","url":"https://bellmar.medium.com/hunting-tech-debt-via-org-charts-92df0b253145","score":13,"flags":2,"comment_count":1,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/bnveyz/hunting_tech_debt_via_org_charts","submitter_user":{"username":"ahuth","created_at":"2020-01-25T23:39:19.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"https://huth.me","is_moderator":false,"karma":451,"avatar_url":"/avatars/ahuth-100.png","invited_by_user":"pacifist"},"tags":["culture","practices"]},{"short_id":"sgd8ft","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sgd8ft","created_at":"2022-01-05T13:02:21.000-06:00","title":"Restore LiveView State on Startup","url":"https://fly.io/phoenix-files/restore-liveview-state-on-startup/","score":6,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/sgd8ft/restore_liveview_state_on_startup","submitter_user":{"username":"tbonesteaks","created_at":"2019-09-24T11:30:46.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Feel free to email me: 8e99a790-ca26-4895-9ac4-9cdfa208d761@anonaddy.me","is_moderator":false,"karma":935,"avatar_url":"/avatars/tbonesteaks-100.png","invited_by_user":"wink"},"tags":["elixir"]},{"short_id":"hwzaii","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwzaii","created_at":"2022-01-05T12:02:47.000-06:00","title":"Neural Network From Scratch","url":"https://sirupsen.com/napkin/neural-net","score":8,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/hwzaii/neural_network_from_scratch","submitter_user":{"username":"napkindrawing","created_at":"2014-05-14T10:03:04.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Dad.
